### About this repository 

This repository contains all the code associated with the Android app that lets you take a picture, which then gets converted into pixel data. A random forest model trained on the MNIST data set is then applied on the pixel data to make a prediction. The predicted digits are printed and shown in the app.

### Future Work

Deployment of the app on Play Store
